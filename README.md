# Trade Matching Engine

A high-performance, low-latency trade matching engine implemented in C++.

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing a trade matching engine with emphasis on performance optimization, concurrency, and efficient data structures. The purpose is to learn how to write scalable, high-performance C++ code.

## Features
- Fast order book implementation
- Efficient order matching algorithm
- Low-latency design
- Thread-safe concurrent operations
- Optimized memory management

## Building the Project
```bash
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Architecture
The trade matching engine is built with these core components:
- Order Book: Maintains buy and sell orders
- Matching Engine: Core logic for matching orders
- Order Management: Handles incoming and outgoing orders
- Market Data Feed: Provides market updates

## Performance Considerations
- Lock-free data structures where possible
- Memory pool allocation
- Cache-friendly data layouts
- Minimizing system calls
- SIMD operations for performance-critical sections
